This project builds on a recently submitted abstract (under review) for the 2023 Biennial Meeting of the Society for Research in Child Development.

This study is being completed at the University of Arizona by PI Alicia Allen, PhD, MPH. Data for this project will not be shared publicly in this repository and may not be used without the express permission of Dr. Alicia Allen.
